### DSCI 5240 -  Data Mining

#### Overview
This repository contains a series of machine learning experiments conducted on an insurance dataset. The dataset includes features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, average daily steps, gym frequency, occupation, and region, among others. The goal of the analysis is to preprocess the data, explore clustering methods, and develop classification and regression models to derive meaningful insights.
